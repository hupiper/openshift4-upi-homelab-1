# OpenShift 4 UPI Home Lab Installation

I followed these steps to build out my OpenShift 4.3 UPI home lab using Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) virtual machines.  Official documentation on a bare-metal installation is provided [here](
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/user-provisioned).

## Architecture
* 1 helper node (RHEL7, 4 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 30 GB disk)
* 1 bootstrap node (CoreOS, 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 120 GB disk)
* 3 control plane nodes (each CoreOS, 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 120 GB disk)
* 2 compute nodes (each CoreOS, 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 120 GB disk)

## Installation

### 1. Set up helper node

I followed instructions from this [Git repository] to build out a UPI helper node.  This allowed me to satisfy load balancing, DHCP, PXE, DNS, and HTTPD requirements.  I ran `nmcli device show` from the helper node to populate the DHCP section of vars.yaml since the helper node will function as DNS/DHCP for the cluster.  At this time, don't run the helper node configuration playbook yet.

### 2. Bare metal installation

I continued with a [bare metal installation], following the steps in the documentation:
  * Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent
  * Obtaining the installation program
    * Place `openshift-install` binary in this Git repository's home directory
  * Installing the OpenShift Command-line Interface
  * Manually creating the installation configuration file
    * To get started, an example has been placed in the save directory and can be used with the following command: `cp save/install-config-example.yaml save/install-config.yaml`
    * Replace the contents of `save/install-config.yaml` with your custom configuration

### 3. Create virtual machines

For this step, "Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines using an ISO image", I proceeded as follows.
  * In RHEV, I created the VMs for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes.
  * For disks, I used Preallocated for the masters and Thin Provisioning for the bootstrap and compute nodes.  The etcd database on masters is I/O intensive and thus Preallocated is recommended.
  * While creating the VMs booted from CD-ROM using a downloaded version of this ISO locally hosted in RHEV:
    * OpenShift 4.3 - https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.3/4.3.0/rhcos-4.3.0-x86_64-installer.iso
    * OpenShift 4.2 - https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/4.2.0/rhcos-4.2.0-x86_64-installer.iso
    * OpenShift 4.1 - https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.1/4.1.0/rhcos-4.1.0-x86_64-installer.iso

### 4. Configure DHCP

  * While still in RHEV, I noted the MAC addresses of the network interfaces by populating the macaddr field of the bootstrap, masters, and workers sections of vars.yaml.
  * At this point, I have the information needed to configure DHCP so I ran the helper node configuration playbook with the following command:
   ```
   ansible-playbook -e @vars.yaml tasks/main.yml
   ```
  * Add the api and api-int URLs to `/etc/hosts` on your helper node:
   ```
   <your-helper-node-ip> api.<your-clusterid>.<your-cluster-domain>
   <your-helper-node-ip> api-int.<your-clusterid>.<your-cluster-domain>
   ```

### 5. Create the manifests and ignition config files

  * Run the helper script to create the manifests file: `create-manifests-config.sh`
  * Run the helper script to create the ignition config file: `./create-ignition-configs.sh`
    * The Ignition config files should be placed in the web directory of the httpd server on the UPI helper node: `chmod 644 *.ign; cp *.ign /var/www/html/ignition/; restorecon -vR /var/www/html/`
    * Run `/usr/local/bin/helpernodecheck install-info` for more info.

### 6. Install RHCOS

I started all of the VMs to install RHCOS.  On the "Install CoreOS" screen, I pressed Tab and added the following to specify the corresponding Ignition and BIOS files:
   ```
   For bootstrap node:
   coreos.inst.install_dev=sda coreos.inst.image_url=http://my-helper-node:8080/install/bios.raw.gz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://my-helper-node:8080/ignition/bootstrap.ign

   For master node:
   coreos.inst.install_dev=sda coreos.inst.image_url=http://my-helper-node:8080/install/bios.raw.gz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://my-helper-node:8080/ignition/master.ign

   For worker node:
   coreos.inst.install_dev=sda coreos.inst.image_url=http://my-helper-node:8080/install/bios.raw.gz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://my-helper-node:8080/ignition/worker.ign
   ```

   The BIOS file was created by the helper node playbook and is a local clone of the upstream mirror:
   * OpenShift 4.3 - https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.3/4.3.0/rhcos-4.3.0-x86_64-metal.raw.gz
   * OpenShift 4.2 - https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/4.2.0/rhcos-4.2.0-x86_64-metal-bios.raw.gz
   * OpenShift 4.1 - https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.1/4.1.0/rhcos-4.1.0-x86_64-metal-bios.raw.gz

   The CoreOS wrote to disk and requested a reboot, and I reconfigured RHEV to now boot from hard drive.  Upon reboot of each node, they consumed their respective Ignition files.

### 7. Install OpenShift

I kicked off the installation with the following command:
   ```
   ./openshift-install --dir=<installation_directory> wait-for bootstrap-complete --log-level info
   ```

### 8. Verify installation

To verify installation, I ran this helper script: `./complete-install.sh`

## Post Installation

### 9. Configure image registry

In OpenShift 4.3, the image registry operator will start in a Removed state with the following note: "Image Registry has been removed. ImageStreamTags, BuildConfigs and DeploymentConfigs which reference ImageStreamTags may not work as expected. Please configure storage and update the config to Managed state by editing configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io."

Two quick options to configure the Image Registry operator are provided below to get started.  Please note that these are not recommended for production use.

#### 9a. Configure NFS storage

  Refer to these instructions to [configure NFS storage using your helper node].  Refer to the following for additional documentation to [configure NFS storage].

#### 9b. Configure ephemeral storage

  To configure ephemeral storage instead, you can run the following:
  ```
  oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
  ```

  Refer to the following for additional documentation to [configure ephemeral storage].

### 10. Optional: Configure your laptop

To view the console and oauth URLs from your laptop outside of the cluster, add the following entries to your laptop's `/etc/hosts`:
```
<your-laptop-ip> console-openshift-console.apps.<your-cluster-domain>
<your-laptop-ip> oauth-openshift.apps.<your-cluster-domain>
```

### 11. Optional: Configure additional operators
